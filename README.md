GitHub Repo (or any folder) Structure Visualizer

The GitHub Repo Structure Visualizer is a software tool developed in C++/C that allows users to scan a GitHub repository or folder and display a graphical presentation of the project structure in the terminal. This tool is designed to provide a clear and intuitive overview of the organization and hierarchy of files and directories within the repository.
